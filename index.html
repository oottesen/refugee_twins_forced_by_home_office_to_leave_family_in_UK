The boat, which was built for four passengers and carried 17, ran into trouble in the middle of the Mediterranean.</span><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“The waves were far too high,” Jamal said. “I couldn’t move, I was in shock.

Its passengers cold and frightened, but all were still alive. </p><p><br></p><p>Their uncle, Abdo Dabsheh, said the twins had seen people get killed in bomb raids, and they had experienced things two 17-year-olds never should need to. He did<span style="font-size: 1.07rem; line-height: 1.5;">&nbsp;not understand why the UK was not prepared to help them.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re going to have to start a new life alone, without any support. There will be no members of their family, no one who could help them,” said their uncle, Abdo Dabsheh. </p><p><br></p><p>“The situation for refugees in Germany is too bad now. There are a lot of other refugees there. I think the language will also become a problem.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Home Office, Sulaiman and Jamal applied for asylum in Germany, but the twins said they were not made aware such an application existed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the five hours they spent on the German border, police forced them to give their fingerprints, even though they were both underage at the time. Their family believed this was how they were registered as asylum seekers in Germany.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“I tried to say I didn’t want to give them my fingerprints. I was underage, and there was no translator present,” Sulaiman said. “It’s like a game to them. We have to leave, simply because they forced us to give them our fingerprints.”</p></div>
